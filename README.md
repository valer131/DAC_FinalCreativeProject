# DAC_FinalCreativeProject
These are the Maya files I have been working on to create the final project for the degree show.
The files are .ma files, all making up different sections of virtual worlds, with some being variations of one another. For example, I have two identical models for the roads/layout, however, I foucsed on a different camera set up for both.
